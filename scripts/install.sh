# avm CLI binary installation script
# ------------------------------------
#
# Inspired from: [https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaboss/blob/35ce0912/scripts/install.sh]
#
# The purpose of this script is to automate the download and installation
# of the avm binary.
#
# The script does a (simple) platform detection, downloads the binary
# for the detected platform and copies it to a folder in the PATH variable.
#
# Currently the supported platforms are Windows, macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS
# running variations of the sh Unix shells.
#

# 1. check latest avm version
# 2. if avm exists on path, check version
# 2.1  if installed version == latest version, exit
# 2.2  else ask user if they want to replace it
# 2.2.1  no -> exit
# 3. otherwise, save to ~/.avm/bin/avm
# 4. add ~/.avm/bin/avm to path if it does not exist
