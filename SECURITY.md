## Reporting security problems for
Anchor Lang

**DO NOT CREATE A GITHUB ISSUE** to
report a security problem.

Instead please email
anchor-security@solana.org.
Provide a helpful title, detailed
description of the vulnerability and an
exploit
proof-of-concept. Speculative
submissions without proof-of-concept
will be closed
with no further consideration.

If you haven't done so already, please
**enable two-factor auth** in your
GitHub account.

Expect a response as fast as possible
in the advisory, typically within 72
hours.

As a general rule of thumb, we will
look to these questions to evaluate
eligibility:
1. Does the bug affect multiple
contracts? Vulnerabilities don’t have
to affect multiple contracts, but a
more widespread bug is generally
indicative of a fundamental issue with
the library, as opposed to a mistake by
the developer
2. Was the bug public knowledge
previously? This may mean that it’s a
vulnerability class for users of
Anchor, but not an issue within Anchor
itself
3. How complicated is the bug to
trigger? The simpler and more plausible
the proof of concept, the more likely
it is to be a bug in the library

Regardless, if you think you have an
issue, we’d like to hear about it. 

For bugs that affect production code,
we will pay up to $X according to the
following guidelines. This is exclusive
to any bounties claimed from the
protocol. In other words, reports can’t
double-dip. 
- Critical: X. Bypass of fundamental
Anchor checks, such as account
ownership, discriminator, memory
safety, etc. 
- Medium: X. Denial of service 
- Low: X: All remaining issues

If you do not receive a response in the
advisory, send an email to
anchor-security@solana.org with the
full URL of the advisory you have
created.  DO NOT
include attachments or provide detail
sufficient for exploitation regarding
the
security issue in this email. **Only
provide such details in the
advisory**.

## Incident Response Process

In case an incident is discovered or
reported, the following process will be
followed to contain, respond and
remediate:

### 1. Accept the new report
In response a newly reported security
problem, a member of the
`solana-foundation/admins` group will
accept the report to turn it into a
draft
advisory.  The
`solana-foundation/anchor-security-incident-response`
group should be added to
the draft security advisory, and create
a private fork of the repository (grey
button towards the bottom of the page)
if necessary.

If the advisory is the result of an
audit finding, follow the same process
as above but add the auditor's github
user(s) and begin the title with
"[Audit]".

If the report is out of scope, a member
of the `solana-foundation/admins` group
will
comment as such and then close the
report.

### 2. Triage
Within the draft security advisory,
discuss and determine the severity of
the issue. If necessary, members of the
`solana-foundation/anchor-security-incident-response`
group may add other github users to the
advisory to assist.
If it is determined that this is not a
critical network issue then the
advisory should be closed and if more
follow-up is required a normal Solana
public github issue should be created.

### 3. Prepare Fixes
For the affected branches, typically
all three (edge, beta and stable),
prepare a fix for the issue and push
them to the corresponding branch in the
private repository associated with the
draft security advisory.
There is no CI available in the private
repository so you must build from
source and manually verify fixes.
Code review from the reporter is ideal,
as well as from multiple members of the
core development team.

### 4. Notify Security Group
Once an ETA is available for the fix, a
member of the
`solana-foundation/anchor-security-incident-response`
group should notify major affected
parties.
The teams are all over the world and
it's critical to provide actionable
information at the right time. Don't be
the person that wakes everybody up at
2am when a fix won't be available for
hours.

### 5. Ship the patch
Once the fix is accepted it may be
distributed directly to develoers as a
patch, depending on the vulnerability.

### 6. Public Disclosure and Release
Once the fix has been deployed to major
affected parties, the patches from the
security advisory may be merged into
the main source repository. A new
official release for each affected
branch should be shipped and all
parties requested to upgrade as quickly
as possible.

### 7. Security Advisory Bounty
Accounting and Cleanup
If this issue is
[eligible](#eligibility) for a bounty,
prefix the title of the
security advisory with one of the
following, depending on the severity:

- [Bounty Category:
Critical](#critical): X. Bypass of
fundamental Anchor checks, such as
account ownership, discriminator,
memory safety, etc. 
- [Bounty Category: Medium](#medium):
X. Denial of service 
- [Bounty Category: Low](#low): X: All
remaining issues

Confirm with the reporter that they
agree with the severity assessment, and
discuss as required to reach a
conclusion.

We currently do not use the Github
workflow to publish security
advisories. Once the issue and fix have
been disclosed, and a bounty category
is assessed if appropriate, the GitHub
security advisory is no longer needed
and can be closed.

## Security Bug Bounties
At its sole discretion, the Solana
Foundation may offer a bounty for
[valid reports](#reporting) of critical
Solana vulnerabilities. Please see
below
for more details. The submitter is not
required to provide a
mitigation to qualify.

#### IMPORTANT | PLEASE NOTE
_Note: Payments will continue to be
paid out in 12-month locked SOL._

<a name="critical"></a>
#### Critical:
_Max: X SOL tokens. Min: Y SOL tokens_

* Bypassing fundamental Anchor checks,
such as account ownership,
discriminator, memory safety, etc.

<a name="medium"></a>
#### Medium:
_Max: X SOL tokens. Min: Y SOL tokens_

* Denial of service attacks

<a name="low"></a>
#### Low:
_Max: X SOL tokens. Min: Y SOL tokens_

* All remaining issues

* Attacks to devex infrastructure

### Out of Scope:
The following components are out of
scope for the bounty program
* Any encrypted credentials, auth
tokens, etc. checked into the repo
* Bugs in dependencies. Please take
them upstream!
* Attacks that require social
engineering
* Any undeveloped automated tooling
(scanners, etc) results. (OK with
developed PoC)
* Any asset whose source code does not
exist in this repository (including,
but not limited
to, any and all web properties not
explicitly listed on this page)

### Eligibility:
* Anyone under a grant or the financial
arrangement with Solana Foundation to
develop or audit related tools is not
eligibile
* Submissions _MUST_ include an exploit
proof-of-concept to be considered
eligible
* The participant submitting the bug
report shall follow the process
outlined within this document
* Valid exploits can be eligible even
if they are not successfully executed
on a public cluster
* Multiple submissions for the same
class of exploit are still eligible for
compensation, though may be compensated
at a lower rate, however these will be
assessed on a case-by-case basis
* Participants must complete KYC and
sign the participation agreement here
when the registrations are open
https://solana.org/kyc. Security
exploits will still be assessed and
open for submission at all times. This
needs only be done prior to
distribution of tokens.

### Duplicate Reports
Compensation for duplicative reports
will be split among reporters with
first to report taking priority using
the following equation
```
R: total reports
ri: report priority
bi: bounty share

bi = 2 ^ (R - ri) / ((2^R) - 1)
```
#### Bounty Split Examples
| total reports | priority | share  |
| ------------- | -------- | -----: |
| 1             | 1        | 100%   |
| 2             | 1        | 66.67% |
| 2             | 2        | 33.33% |
| 3             | 1        | 57.14% |
| 3             | 2        | 28.57% |
| 3             | 3        | 14.29% |
| 4             | 1        | 53.33% |
| 4             | 2        | 26.67% |
| 4             | 3        | 13.33% |
| 4             | 4        |  6.67% |
| 5             | 1        | 51.61% |
| 5             | 2        | 25.81% |
| 5             | 3        | 12.90% |
| 5             | 4        |  6.45% |
| 5             | 5        |  3.23% |

### Payment of Bug Bounties:
* Bounties are currently awarded on a
rolling/weekly basis and paid out
within 30 days upon receipt of an
invoice.
* Bug bounties that are paid out in SOL
are paid to stake accounts with a
lockup expiring 12 months from the date
of delivery of SOL.
