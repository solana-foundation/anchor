notably a race condition when deploying programs. We cover the most important 
changes below, but be sure to check out the full list of changes in the

## How to upgrade

1. Update `anchor-cli`:

   ```sh
   avm install 0.32.1
   ```

2. Update Anchor crate(s) to `0.32.1`.

3. Update TS package(s) to `0.32.1`.

## Recommended Solana Version

The recommended Solana version is `2.3.0`.

You can install the newer tooling by running:

```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/v2.3.0/install)"
```

## CLI

### Fix `anchor deploy` race condition

With the addition of deploying the IDL on every program deploy by default, a 
race condition was introduced that was not found in initial testing. We have 
added a wait until the program is completely available before continuing the
deployment of the IDL.

## lang

### Fix warnings and prelude solana-program inclusion

There was still a warning leftover for deprecation of realloc in 0.32.0. This
has been remediated in this release.
