## Zeroed Discriminators

Anchor supports overriding discriminators with custom values (for accounts, events and instructions).
All-zero discriminators are only supported in events and instructions. In the case of accounts, e.g:
```rust
#[account(discriminator = [0, 0, 0])]
#[account(discriminator = 0)]
#[account(discriminator = ZERO_CONSTANT)]
```
are illegal. The [`zero` constraint](/docs/references/account-constraints#accountzero) may be used instead.
